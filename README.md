# LS_DS10_BuildWeek  

### From my Portfolio  
The medium article speaks for itself but this project was to showcase my data wrangling and visualization skills. My research question was: Did the economic recession in The United States effect suicide rates in America? And if so, who was the most effected by it?  

### Looking Back 
This repository is my colab notebook support for the medium article I wrote about suicide statistics and the United States stock market. A link to the medium article can be found [here](https://medium.com/@ethanm.jansen/the-united-states-market-crash-of-2008-and-its-effect-on-suicide-rate-c9133c04169d). It's primative structure shows that this was my very first project, in retrospect I look back and like how the notebook was structured but I would like to add more information about the process I took and which pieces were tricky.
